# Solving Traveling Salesman Problem using Genetic Algorithms

This is a school project that I made in December 2020. Comments and variables are written in Serbian language because I also wrote a paper on this topic. The paper is also provided in my repository.

At the moment this is a basic Console Application that solves TSP with default or custom parameters.
In the future I will make a simple GUI and implement more types of GA, so the user can choose which algorithm to use.
